  **Mobile Frame Zero: Rapid Attack** is a tabletop wargame for 2 to 5 players.
  Build your squad of tiny giant robots out of Lego® and fight for control of
  the Free Colonies in the year SC 0245.


  Reaching out from Earth and Mars towards the cosmos, the Solar Union has conquered many worlds. But when it reached the homeworld of the alien Ijad, the SU met its first real opposition. Fiercely religious, the Ijad use the invaders' own technology against them, fighting to turn back the tide of colonisation. And now, inspired by the Ijad and rising against the Solar Union are the humans of the newly-formed Free Colonies.
