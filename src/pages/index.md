  commissions or assembling kits, you’ll want to ask around at the [Mobile Frame
  Zero Discord](https://discord.gg/KhdKCWp) For players who already have a big
  pile of LEGO® bricks, there are instructions in the rulebook, and you can get
  help and inspiration from the amazing mecha designers at the [Mobile Frame
  Zero Flickr group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/438009@N25/), the blog [No
  B.S., Just ABS](http://nobsjustabs.wordpress.com/), and the [Mobile Frame

introText: "**Mobile Frame Zero: Rapid Attack** is a game where you never have
  enough time or material to make your plans easy. When your robots take a hit,
  they lose vital parts! When you make a decision, you know Doomsday is coming
  and you can’t take it back! There’s never enough cover to safely get where you
  need to go!"
